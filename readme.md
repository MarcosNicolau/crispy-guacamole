## Yet another awesome collection

This repo is a collection of all the assignments, mock tests and exercises I've done through the advanced graphics techniques elective class at UTN FRBA.

We work with [Monogame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame), a powerful open source game dev framework that re-implements Microsoft's XNA.

To run the games you need to:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MarcosNicolau/crispy-guacamole.git`
2. Pull the assets: `git lfs pull`
3. Cd into the game and run: `dotnet run`

PD: you'd also need to have monogame installed.
